# Flask App Deployment using GitOps Principles

## Introduction
In ABC organization, one of the most critical challenges hindering software development and delivery process is the lack of end-to-end automation. The absence of a streamlined, automated workflow is impacting organization's efficiency, quality, and competitiveness. The organization currently relies heavily on manual processes and lacks a comprehensive end-to-end automation strategy for software development and delivery pipeline. This has resulted in several key issues:
- Manual, Error-Prone Workflows
- Inconsistent Testing and Quality Assurance
- Slow-Release Cycles
- Limited Scalability

To address these challenges and achieve a more efficient and competitive software development and delivery process, ABC organization has decided to implement end-to-end automation with the help of DevOps Team. The objectives are as follows:
- Streamline Development Pipeline
- Standardize Testing and Quality Assurance
- Accelerate Release Cycles
- Enhance Scalability
- Improve Reliability and Predictability

To address these challenges and achieve the desired state, DevOps Team will embark on a focused initiative to implement end-to-end automation. We will leverage modern tools, methodologies, and best practices to optimize our software development and delivery processes ensuring high-quality with speed and precision.
